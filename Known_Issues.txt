Known Issues:
When using something with checkVersion (such as joomla module) without the -e flag, we need to kill
application flow right after version is detected.  Red and white text at end appear for no reason 


Improvements:

Add detection for FCKEditor.... /CFIDE/scripts/ajax/fckeditor/
/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/upload/test.html
/FCKeditor/editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors/test.html
/editor/filemanager/browser/default/connectors/php/connector.php
/editor/filemanager/upload/php/upload.php
